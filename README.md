#### [Project Report.pdf](https://github.com/anmolbansal7/Parking-Management-System-in-ALP/files/7789381/Micro_Final_Report.pdf)

## What the project is?
The objective of this project is to improve the current parking scenario in hospitals by
- Displaying the number of vacant slots
- The fee that they will be charged
- Ensure an efficient parking facility by reducing the time wasted and unnecessary space.
We plan to implement it by segregating the parking into different lanes for staff-owned
vehicles, visiting vehicles and ambulances to ensure proper allocation of the parking space.
